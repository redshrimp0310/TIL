MVC is an architectural pattern that divides the application into three main logical components: Model View Controller. 
Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
* **Model**</br>
Model component is actually connected to the database. So, it handles data logic. **It ONLY speaks to Controller**. 
* **View**</br>
View component displays the information to the user which is not taken directly from Model but through the controller. **It ONLY speaks to Controller**.
* **Controller**</br>
Controller component receives requests and tells the model component what to do. After receiving data from the model, it sends to the view.
