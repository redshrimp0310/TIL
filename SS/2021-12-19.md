### Ruby & Ruby on rails?
Ruby is an open sourse scripting language. On the other hand, Ruby on rails, aka Rails, 
is an open source web development framework programmed in Ruby based on MVC architecture.

### Ruby Gem?
An open soure Library.

### MVC architecture?
MVC is an architectural pattern that divides the application into three main logical components: Model View Controller. 
Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
* **Model**</br>
Model component is actually connected to the database. So, it handles data logic. **It ONLY speaks to Controller**. 
* **View**</br>
View component displays the information to the user which is not taken directly from Model but through the controller. **It ONLY speaks to Controller**.
* **Controller**</br>
Controller component receives requests and tells the model component what to do. After receiving data from the model, it sends to the view.

### Spring Vs Spring MVC Vs Spring Boot
**Spring** is the most popular APPLICATION development framework. </br>
**Spring MVC** is a Web MVC Framework for building web applications. </br>
**Spring Boot** is a module of Spring Framework allowing us to build a simple Spring-based application or REST APIs.

### JQuery VS NodeJS?
**JQuery** is a JavaScript Library for doing something in the front end.</br>
**NodeJS** is a server side JavaSciprt.

### JavaScript 
* **All numbers are encoded as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard. This format stores numbers in 64 bits.** </br></br>
* **Undefined vs Null** </br>
**undefined** means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</br> **null** is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.</br>
**undefined** - Value : undefined, Type : undefined</br>
**null** - Value : Empty, Type : Object </br></br>
* **Object**
1. Contrainer including the properties(key:value) 
2. It appears to look similar to Hash.
3. Primitive data type can only store one value but Non-primitive(reference) data type can store multiple properties.
4. Property can store primitive data type or another object.
5. Function can be a property of an object and also attribute of another function as it's also considered a value.
6. Method? </br>
A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. </br></br>
* **How to create object?**</br>
JavaScript does not have class type. However, we can create an object using the following methods:
1. Create a single object, using an object literal.
2. Create a single object, with the keyword 'new'.
3. Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
4. Create an object using Object.create().</br></br>
* **How to access the property in Object?**</br>
1. object['property'] - Must be used if property's name is a reserved word or it includes any operator.
2. object.property</br></br>
* **NaN(Not a Number) Value?**</br>
NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value which is not a valid number. 
It can be used to check whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number. ex) 1-'hello' = NaN </br></br>
* **Primitive data type & Non-primitive (reference) data type** </br>
There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:
Number, String, Boolean, Null, and Undefined </br></br>
The non-primitive data types are as follows:
Object, Array, and RegExp
</br></br>
* **Comparision operators?** </br>
1. The strict equality operator === : Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
2. The loose equality operator == : Returns true if the operands are equal.</br></br>
* **Prototype?** </br>
Prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible. Every funtion includes prototype object by default.</br></br>
* **JavaScript? ECMAScript?** </br>
JavaScript is a subset of ECMAScript. JavaScript uses ECMAScript as it's core. </br></br>
* **ES6?** </br>
ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script.</br>
